# Virtual-mouse
This project implements a virtual mouse for macOS controlled entirely by hand gestures using MediaPipe, OpenCV, NumPy, and PyAutoGUI. It allows you to control the mouse pointer, clicks, scrolling, and zooming â€” all through intuitive finger movements, with no physical mouse required.
